          GreenAdopt is a non-profit organization dedicated to environmental conservation, 
          community engagement, and creating a sustainable future for generations to come.

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Founded with a vision to bridge the gap between environmental awareness and action, 
            GreenAdopt emerged from the belief that every individual can make a meaningful impact 
            on our planet. We started as a small community initiative and have grown into a 
            comprehensive environmental conservation platform that connects people with nature 
            through tree adoption programs.

          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            To create a greener, healthier world by empowering communities through environmental 
            education, tree adoption programs, and sustainable practices. We believe in the power 
            of collective action and individual responsibility in addressing climate change and 
            environmental degradation.
